I am Brooklyn-based computer scientist and musician. I am currently a Research Assistant Professor in NYU’s [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://engineering.nyu.edu/academics/departments/computer-science-and-engineering) with affiliations to NYU’s [Music and Audio Research Lab](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/) and the [Center for Urban Science and Progress](http://cusp.nyu.edu/). My research lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, and audio signal processing. My focus is human-centered machine listening and audio processing systems that enable new interactions for observing the acoustic world and creatively expressing through sound. I completed my PhD in computer science at Northwestern University as a member of the [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.eecs.northwestern.edu/), and I hold a Master of Arts from [Stanford University (CCRMA)](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) and a Bachelor of Music from Northwestern University.  Before my current position, I spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher in the Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL) at New York University (NYU). 

As a musician, I exercises my passion for low frequencies, enveloping noise, and textural sound using computers, synthesizers, and bass. With experimental-rock trio [volcano!](https://volcanoisaband.com/), I released albums on The Leaf Label and toured the United States and Europe.
