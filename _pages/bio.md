My [research](/research) lies at the intersection of human-computer interaction, machine learning, and audio signal processing. Specifically, I research human-centered machine listening and audio processing tools for understanding and creating sound.

I am an Assistant Professor at New Jersey Institute of Technology in the [Department of Informatics](https://informatics.njit.edu/) and the head of the [Sound Interaction and Computing (SInC) Lab](http://www.sinc-lab.com). I completed my PhD in computer science at Northwestern University as a member of the [Interactive Audio Lab](http://music.eecs.northwestern.edu/), and I hold a Master of Arts from Stanford University ([CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/)) and a Bachelor of Music from Northwestern University.  Before my current position, I spent four years as a researcher in the [Music and Audio Research Lab (MARL)](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/marl/) and the [Center for Urban Science and Progress (CUSP)](http://cusp.nyu.edu/) at New York University (NYU).
