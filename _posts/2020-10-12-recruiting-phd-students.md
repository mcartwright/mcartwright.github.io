I am hiring PhD students to work with me at [NJIT](https://informatics.njit.edu/) starting in Fall 2021. 

Please [apply](https://www.njit.edu/admissions/phd-programs) if you are interested in working on problems at the intersection HCI and ML applied to music and environmental sound, especially:
- interactive and human-in-the-loop machine listening
- intelligent audio/music production tools
- sound awareness tools

And for those that are interested in the arts and culture of New York City, NJIT is located in Newark, NJ --- just a 20-minute train ride away from NYC!

Application deadline is December 15. 

Please [contact me](mailto:mcartwright@gmail.com) if you have any questions!
